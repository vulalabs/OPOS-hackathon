# OPOS Hackathon Submission - Jupiter Track

Welcome to our project submitted for the OPOS Hackathon under the Jupiter Track.

## Overview

Our solution is aimed at allowing merchants to accept SPL tokens at checkout. Here's a step-by-step guide of how it works:

### 1. Account Creation
   Merchants can create an account using Supabase authentication, ensuring security and convenience.

### 2. Wallet Submission
   Merchants need to submit their wallet information only once, and it gets securely saved to their account.

### 3. Payment Link Creation
   Create a payment link by specifying the item name and price, making the payment request easy and accessible.

### 4. Accept SPL Token Payment
   Accept payments in SPL tokens via a QR code that can be easily scanned by customers.

#### Additional Features
- **QR Code Integration:** Our QR codes are compatible with Phantom mobile for efficient transactions.
- **Token List:** The available token list is pulled from Jupiter Aggregator, providing a wide range of options for transactions.
